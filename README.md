# Serious Engine

This is a fork of Croteam's Serious Engine 1.10 that aims to provide code that is easier to maintain and build under any sort of configuration and that also includes many quality-of-life improvements over the original code without adding too much.

### Engine components
- `DedicatedServer` - Dedicated server application for hosting multiplayer game
- `Ecc` - Entity Class Compiler for compiling entity source files (`*.es`)
- `Engine` - Serious Engine 1.10
- `EngineGUI` - Common GUI components for game tools
- `EntitiesMP` - All the entity logic
- `GameGUIMP` - Specific GUI components for game tools
- `GameMP` - Module for handling basic game logic
- `SeriousSam` - The main game executable
- `Shaders` - Compiled shaders for SKA models

### Engine tools
- `DecodeReport` - Tool for decoding crash report files (`*.rpt`)
- `Depend` - Tool for generating a list of dependency files based on a list of root files
- `MakeFONT` - Tool for generating font files for the game (`*.fnt`)
- `Modeler` - Serious Modeler application for creating and configuring models with vertex animations
- `RCon` - Remote console application for connecting to servers using an admin password
- `SeriousSkaStudio` - Serious SKA Studio application for creating and configuring models with skeletal animations
- `WorldEditor` - Serious Editor application for creating in-game levels

### Other projects
- `LWSkaExporter` - Exporter of SKA models in ASCII format for use in LightWave
- `GameAgent` - Custom master server emulator written in Python
- `libogg`, `libvorbis` - Third party libraries used for playing OGG-encoded ingame music
- `zlib` - Third party static library for working with ZIP archives

These have been modified to run correctly under the recent versions of Windows. (Tested: Win7 x64, Win8 x64, Win8.1 x64, Win10 x64)

# Building

To build Serious Engine 1, you will need **Visual Studio 2010** or later. The engine was originally written using **Visual C++ 6.0** and released to the public modified to build and run correctly using **Visual Studio 2013**.

Once you've installed **Visual Studio** and (optionally) DirectX8 SDK, you can build the engine solution (`Sources/All.sln`). Press F7 or **Build** -> **Build solution**. Once the project is build, the libraries and executables will be copied under the `Bin/` directory.

# Optional features

These features are disabled by default but can be enabled if you wish to extend the capabilities of your Serious Engine build.

Some features that can be customized using macros can be toggled by modifying the `Sources/Engine/SE_Config.h` header file instead of property sheets or project files.

- **DirectX:** Download DirectX8 SDK (headers & libraries) ( https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812 ) and then define a `SE1_D3D` macro for all projects in the solution (you can do it by adding it to the `SE1GenericPreproc` property inside `Sources/Properties/Common.props`). You will also need to make sure the DirectX8 headers and libraries are located in the following folders (make the folder structure if it doesn't exist):
  - `Tools.Win32/Libraries/DX8SDK/Include/`
  - `Tools.Win32/Libraries/DX8SDK/Lib/`
- **3Dfx:** Support for this outdated driver for outdated graphics cards is still present but is disabled in favor of modernity. To enable it, define a `SE1_3DFX` macro for all projects in the solution.
- **MP3 playback:** Copy `amp11lib.dll` library that used to be distributed with older versions of **Serious Sam Classic: The First Encounter** near the executable files under the `Bin/` directory.
- **3D Exploration**: Support is disabled due to copyright issues. If you need to create new models, either use editing tools from any of the original games or write your own code for 3D object import/export.
- **IFeel:** Support is disabled due to copyright issues. If you need IFeel support, copy `IFC22.dll` and `ImmWrapper.dll` from the original games near the executable files under the `Bin/` directory.
- **Truform:** Its functionality is disabled by default. To enable it, you need to switch the `SE1_TRUFORM` macro to `1` (or define it as such for all projects).
- **Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL):** It's included with the source code and is initialized by the engine but its functionality is mostly unused by default for the Windows platform. To prioritize it over Win32 API, you need to switch the `SE1_USE_SDL` macro to `1` (or define it as such for all projects).
  - It is always prioritized on non-Windows platforms because cross-platform code cannot function without it.
- **The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW):** It's included with the source code but its functionality is disabled by default. To enable it, you need to switch the `SE1_GLEW` macro to `1` (or define it as such for all projects).
  - Defining the macro with `2` makes it replace internal OpenGL hooking in the engine with GLEW methods, in case you intend to write new code using GLEW that's compatible with the engine.

# Running

This version of the engine comes with a set of resources (`SE1_10.gro`) that allow you to freely use the engine without any additional resources required. However if you want to open or modify levels from **Serious Sam Classic: The First Encounter** or **The Second Encounter** (including most user-made levels), you will have to copy the game's resources (`.gro` files) into the game folder.

When running a selected project, make sure that its project settings under **Debugging** are setup correctly:
- Command: `$(PostBuildCopyDir)$(TargetFileName)`
- Working Directory: `$(SolutionDir)..\`

# Common problems

- `SeriousSkaStudio` has some issues with MFC windows that can prevent the main window from being displayed properly.
- Static building works with MFC applications but applications themselves don't function properly because resource files from `EngineGUI` and `GameGUIMP` modules are being omitted when executables link them (e.g. no dialogs for opening/saving files or creating textures).
  - Because of this, `EngineGUI`, `GameGUIMP`, `Modeler`, `SeriousSkaStudio` and `WorldEditor` projects lack static build configurations for now.
- Even though **Visual Studio 2010** can be used for building, its compiler seems to be introducing certain bugs that are not ironed out yet, so it's suggested that you use **Visual Studio 2013** or higher. Serious Engine 1.10 was initially released for these versions.
  - Projects use `$(DefaultPlatformToolset)` property for automatically selecting the toolset from the studio that you're using, which doesn't exist in **Visual Studio 2010**. You will have to manually change it to `v100`.
